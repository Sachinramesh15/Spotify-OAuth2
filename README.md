# Spotify-OAuth2
The script uses the OAuth2 ROPG authorization flow to obtain an access token from the Spotify API. With this access token, it makes a request to fetch details about a particular playlist identified by its ID. It then extracts information such as the playlist owner's name and the names of the tracks in the playlist. Finally, it writes this information to a CSV file for further analysis or processing.
